### Course description

A study of the craft and deployment of procedurally-generated digital narratives, placing an emphasis on using data sources and computational methods as storytelling media. Students focus on critical, close reading of professional and student works while completing a single long-form work of their own. Topics include natural language processing (NLP), procedural illustration, computational constraint, and the development of conceptual documentary works.

* Prerequisite knowledge: `CMPSC 101`
* Distribution requirements: `HE`, `ME`
