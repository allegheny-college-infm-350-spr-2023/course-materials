### Course description

#### Canonical course description

A study of the craft and deployment of procedurally-generated digital narratives, placing an emphasis on using data sources and computational methods as storytelling media. Students focus on critical, close reading of professional and student works while completing a single long-form work of their own. Topics include natural language processing (NLP), procedural illustration, computational constraint, and the development of conceptual documentary works.

* Prerequisite knowledge: `CMPSC 101`
* Distribution requirements: `HE`, `ME`

#### Less canonical (but still very official) course notes

This course may differ quite a bit from others you have taken. The following table provides a breakdown of what each of these sessions are, with
the caveat that session purposes may change slightly given course circumstances.

|Day of the week           |Session Type |Session purpose            |
|--------------------------|-------------|---------------------------|
|Monday                    |Class        |Discussion, activities     |
|Monday                    |Lab          |Continued discussion, planning, work time |
|Wednesday                 |Feedback     |Informal course discussion of works-in-progress |
|Friday                    |Workshop     |(More) formal class discussion of draft work |

* Sasha Stiles, _Technelegy_, Eyewear

##### Texts distributed by professor

* Greg Borenstein, _Generative Detective_
* Liza Daly, _Seraphs_
* Allison Parrish, _Compasses_

#### Platforms

This course relies on the [GitHub](https://www.github.com) and (eventually) [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) platforms. Your work will be assigned and evaluated using these platforms and official course communication will take place through them. You are expected to sign up for accounts and remain active on these platforms throughout the semester.

##### A note on use of class platforms

These platforms are for our use only. To use them, you'll need to register and be logged into accounts associated with your Allegheny College email.

#### Course languages

This course will use:

* `Python`
* `Javascript`
  * in particular, the `Node.js` variety

I don't expect you to be experts in either of them. Hopefully, we'll have an opportunity to explore these _qua_ computer languages before we do anything too complicated. Of course, I welcome any other language in which you're comfortable. However, assignments will be templated in either of the above two languages depending on the task assigned.

#### Assignments

##### Statement on platforms

All course assignments are assigned and evaluated using the GitHub platform. I will only assess work correctly placed there. While we may use multiple platforms for _doing_ the work, the final versions _must_ be on GitHub. Though the previous set of statements implies the following, I state it explicitly here to avoid misunderstanding: 

> I _will not_ grade work which is not submitted to GitHub.

##### Assignment types

This course works through `3` types of assignments:

* Creative projects
  * incl. final project
* Workshop feedback
* Reading discussion

###### Creative projects

These serve as the soul of our course. Each will focus on techniques, concepts, and understandings that we will develop as the semester unfolds. These projects will mimic or investigate some aspect of the reading supporting our weekly discussion. The prompts will feature some basic techno-artistic specifications, but are essentially open-ended (with some guidance and concrete expectations attached). 

Students are expected to complete `10` of these throughout the semester, taking the week off when it's their time to present a text. The final project is not included in this number and is additional to the `10` regular assignments completed throughout the semester.

###### Workshop participation and feedback

As this course is as much about _how we think_ about computational tools interfacing with the world of language, you will be responsible for recording and processing your responses to the work your fellow creators generate.

Each week, `3` students will provide work for discussion during our `Friday` session. A predetermined list of `3` students must write a `350`-`500` word response which considers various dimensions of the work as relates to the theme or concerns of the text we're reading/presenting each week. These letters, informed by notes taken before and during `Friday` sessions, are due by the end of the day (read: `23:59`) on `Sunday`.

Students responsible for writing letters are responsible for assisting the instructor to facilitate a reasonable discussion, as they should have -- at the minimum -- notes about the work being discussed.

Students submitting work to the workshop session are not required to write letters for that week.

###### Reading discussion

There are few solid "technical indicators" for the kind of work we're looking at; while the genre isn't _new_, it's certainly not as well-established as, say, the form of the _novel_. In keeping with the course's interest in exploring work from the perspective of understanding _why_ these works exist rather than strictly _how_ they're achieved, one discussion will be lead by each member of the course. 

The assignment sheet, given as a separate repository, will provide areas for consideration and requirements for completion. These discussions will begin the second full week of class. Each student will serve as a discussion leader `1` time, and is not responsible for generating work in response to the text or prompt given that week.

#### Evaluation

Our work, given its subjective nature, cannot neatly fit into a traditional graded system. While technical concerns and specifications underlie
everything we do this semester, we should be more interested in the _labor_ and _process_ of this work or, at the very least, its technical
achievement than its durable quality. It's complicated to evaluate the areas highlighted above. However, this is why this course is graded by
a [Course Contract](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) which speaks more to process than product.

I advise you to read this contract to more completely understand the additional responsibilities that a model like this presumes.

### Allegheny College Statement of Community

Allegheny College also expects students and faculty to act according to its Statement of Community:

> Allegheny students and employees are committed to creating an inclusive, respectful and safe residential learning community that will actively confront and challenge racism, sexism, heterosexism, religious bigotry, and other forms of harassment and discrimination. We encourage individual growth by promoting a free exchange of ideas in a setting that values diversity, trust and equality. So that the right of all to participate in a shared learning experience is upheld, Allegheny affirms its commitment to the principles of freedom of speech and inquiry, while at the same time fostering responsibility and accountability in the exercise of these freedoms. This statement does not replace existing personnel policies and codes of conduct.

Keep both of these standards in mind as you exercise your academic inquiry in this course. These serve as our fundamental "first principles" in pursuit of our shared academic goals.

### Honor Code

All students and faculty at Allegheny College are bound by the Honor Code. Everyone expects that your behavior reflects this commitment. Given the eminently shareable and reproducible nature of code, the Department of Computer Science adds the following statement to the general college policy:

> It is recognized that an important part of the learning process in any course, and particularly in computer science, derives from thoughtful discussions with teachers, student assistants, and fellow students.  Such dialogue is encouraged.  However, it is necessary to distinguish carefully between the student who discusses the principles underlying a problem with others, and the student who produces assignments that are identical to, or merely variations on, someone else’s work.  It will therefore be understood that all assignments submitted to faculty of the Department of Computer Science are to be the original work of the student submitting the assignment, and should be signed in accordance with the provisions of the Honor Code.  Appropriate action will be taken when assignments give evidence that they were derived from the work of others.

As the nature of "plagiarism" and constituents of "fair use" change often, the department encourages you to periodically review the specific tenets of the general college Honor Code provided in the latest course catalog and in the _Compass_.

The above statement, of course, also applies to online forums such as Stack Overflow, et al.

#### A caveat, or the strange case of large language models (`LLM`)

The above statements (including the official college policy on plagiarism) establishes some broad assumptions about the originality and creativity behind standard coursework. In the context of this course, some of those are pretty bogus. While I won't make an itemized list of these issues, it will be up to us to understand what it means to essentially remix language which is most likley _not ours_ continuously. I propose the following "Golden Rule" based on the idea of "fair use."

##### Golden Rule

A work is only truly plagiaristic if it wholesale replaces or does not in any way meaningfully alter the original language used to generate it or significantly modify its context.

### Classroom ethics

The discipline of computer science, like many others, encourages its members to act according to discipline-specific ethics. I encourage you to take time to review the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) [Code of Ethics](https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/about/acm-code-of-ethics-booklet.pdf).

### Seeking assistance

#### Assistance with course concepts

Students who struggle to understand knowledge and skills defined in this course are encouraged to seek assistance from the Mayor and teaching assistants. To meet with me, consult my available office hours (above) and make an appointment.

Historically, students who are successful in my courses visit and discuss course concepts with the Mayor and Technical Leaders early and often. See [above for my office hours](#office-hours) or go to [this schedule for Technical Leaders' office hours](https://www.cs.allegheny.edu/teaching/technicalleaders/).

#### Assistance outside of the course

If you find yourself in difficult circumstances which affect your ability to participate in or complete course work, let me know immediately. Full stop.

Do not wait until the end of the semester. 

It is part of my job to make sure that students receive the assistance they need. Do not hesitate to let me know if there is anything I can do with respect to your ability to handle your work. This is especially true of our current circumstances. Again, let me remind you -- __**it is part of my job**__ to help you access Allegheny College resources that will enable your safety and success.

In many situations, the following list of resources may help:

* [The Maytum Learning Commons](https://sites.allegheny.edu/learningcommons/)
* [Allegheny College Counseling Center](https://sites.allegheny.edu/learningcommons/)
