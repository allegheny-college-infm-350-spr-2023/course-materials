Additionally, this course's design presumes and supports a small, tight-knit, though temporary, community of creators. Here, you have additional
responsibilities above and beyond meeting project specifications. We all expect each other to produce work and provide feedback on that work which
speaks to our joys, difficulties, and misunderstandings with it.
